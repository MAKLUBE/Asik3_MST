# DAA Assignment 3 â€” Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

**Sakenov Rassul** â€” SE-2435  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Implementation and comparison of **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms  
for constructing a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** in a weighted undirected graph.

The program:
- Reads graph data from `input.json`
- Builds MST using both algorithms
- Records results to `output.json` and `results.csv`
- Measures execution time and operation count



## Validation & Testing

All tests implemented in **`MSTTest.java`**.

### âœ” Correctness Tests
- MST total cost is identical for both algorithms
- Number of edges = **V âˆ’ 1**
- MST is **acyclic** (no cycles)
- MST connects all vertices (single component)
- Handles **disconnected graphs** gracefully

### âš™ Performance & Consistency Tests
- Execution time â‰¥ 0 (ms)
- Operation count â‰¥ 0
- Results reproducible for same dataset

### ðŸ§¾ Test Output

## ðŸ§  Conclusion

Both **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms successfully generate a minimum spanning tree (MST)  
with identical total cost, confirming algorithmic correctness.

- Kruskal performs better on **sparse** graphs
- Prim performs better on **dense** graphs
- Execution times and operation counts are consistent and non-negative
